# Image Segmentation and Analysis of Features
This is a part of the work done as a Research Intern at ARTPARK in Robot Perception.

This repository mainly contains the documentation of observations and results obtained on testing different traditional as well as state-of-the-art algorithms (and also the code used) in the following two subtopics:

1. Image Segmentation
2. Feature Extraction, Matching and Tracking


<I>N.B.</I> - Most of the code repos in the deep learning based models are cloned from their official implementations as cited at www.paperswithcode.com
