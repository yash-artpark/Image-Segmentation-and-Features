# Image Segmentation and Analysis of Features
This is a part of the work done as a Research Intern at ArtPark in Robot Perception.

This repository mainly contains the documentation of observations and results obtained on testing different traditional as well as state-of-the-art algorithms (and also the code) in the following two subtopics:

1. Image Segmentation
2. Feature Extraction, Matching and Tracking


P.S. - Most of the code repos in the deep learning based models are cloned from their official implementations cited at www.paperswithcode.com
