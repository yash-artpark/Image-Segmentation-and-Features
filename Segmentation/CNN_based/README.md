Please find the 'expt.ipynb' notebook in each of the neural nets' implementation. Run it to generate the results as documented in the report. The directory hierarchy to find the notebook is as follows:

1. For BiSeNet - /BiSeNet/tools/expt.ipynb
2. For ShelfNet - /ShelfNet18_realtime/expt.ipynb


P.S. - You may find many unnecessary files or even unnecessary README.mds (unnecessary with respect to the documented experiments) in these folders, please ignore them as these directories have been directly cloned from the official implementations. Just run the expt.ipynb notebooks in the given directories to get the results
